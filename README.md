# What is it?
A responsive website a 'ballot paper' used during Music Show - Eurovision Song Contest. Project consists of a list of all songs performing in a competition and has field to vote for the songs by assigning them points. At the end it summarizes the user's points and gives the song with the highest amount of points. 

# Tech stuff
Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Fetching data from self made json file.

# Future idea
For the next year I was thinking to enhance the project by giving the opportunity to submit the name of all users, players in the game. It would require implementing some backend. On finishing it would send a post web request with a name (from text field) and all scores to the backend.
